The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file contains instructions on how to contribute to this repository. It includes information on how to fork and clone the repository, create a branch, make changes, commit and push, and open a pull request. These instructions are also broadly applicable to most GitHub repositories.

- [.gitignore](#gitignore-file)
The `.gitignore` file is used to specify which files and directories should be ignored by Git, the version control system. This means that any files or directories listed in the `.gitignore` file will not be tracked by Git, and changes to these files will not be included in commits.
